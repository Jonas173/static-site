                Having worked as a C# developer since January of 2020, I have experience in creating professional
                Desktop applications as well as REST-ful Webservices via ASP.NET.

            <p>
                Recently coming in contact with Blazor WebAssembly, I'm set on teaching myself web development. I've
                started with the basics of HTML structuring and CSS layouting by building this static site and aim to
                set up a sample SPA in either React or Angular to build up a JavaScipt skillset.

        <p>I've recently started developing a frontend for a mock e-shop, which is realised as a single page application
            via React.js.</p>
        <p>The code is available <a href="https://github.com/Jonas173/e-shopping-front" target="popup" id="react-link">here</a>.</p>
